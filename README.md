## Project Overview

The **Population Reporting System** is designed to allow users to generate reports on population statistics from a MySQL database. 
The system connects to the database, retrieves population data, and provides easy-to-read reports on various metrics, 
including country, city, and language statistics. This project demonstrates the integration of Java with an SQL database, 
using Docker for containerisation and Maven for build management.

Continuous Integration (CI) workflows have been set up using GitHub Actions to ensure stable builds and testing of the project.
